        Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a
        prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
        Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We
        have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named
        Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures.  Please take a look at the feature requests section to learn how you can help us.
      </p>
